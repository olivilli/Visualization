## Power BI Projects Overview

- **[Financials](PowerBI/Financials)**: This project is my first data visualization in Power BI, using the built-in dataset as the data source. 
In Power Query, I refined the table by keeping only date, manufacturer information, product details, and sales data.

- **[Supermarket](PowerBI/Supermarket)**: For this project, I used a publicly available dataset containing information about a supermarket
chain, including products, customers, and sales. Key features include:
1. Decomposition Tree: To explore drivers of various metrics within each category.
2. Drillthrough Pages: Allowing users to navigate easily to detailed analysis pages.
3. Parameter Control: A dynamic parameter that lets users select the metric they want to optimize, such as quantity, profit, or sales.

- **[Salaries](PowerBI/Salaries)**: Project visualizes the data analytics job market from 2020 to 2023, focusing on roles, 
expertise levels, salaries, and company sizes.
